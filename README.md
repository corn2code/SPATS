In this repository, you will find the code to correct for spatial effects. We will use the data from the paper "[Population-level gene expression can repeatedly link genes to functions in maize](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tpj.16801)". Please note that the results are a bit different to the published ones since this is an improved code.
